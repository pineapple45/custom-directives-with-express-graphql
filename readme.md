I am using React as my frontend frameworks but you can easily use any other frontend framework such as Angular or svelte. Few other technologies that I am using on my frontend are:

- [@apollo/client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apollo/client)
- [Material-UI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@material-ui/core)
- [Typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript)

üëâ Note: [Main](https://github.com/pineapple45/custom-directives-with-express-graphql/tree/main) branch consists the final code along with deployment workflows , client & server complete setup

üëâ Note: client-redux folder also consists of frontend with client graphql implementation using redux. Although , it is important to note that, functionalities such live as refetching of queries , implementaion of custom fetch and error policies is not implemented in this project.
